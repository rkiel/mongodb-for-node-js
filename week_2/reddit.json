I came to realize that if I had $10 000 in debt and added $500, that $500 would actually be the last thing I paid off on that debt instead of the first.\n\nUsing this mentality, I stopped using my LoC almost completely, because every purchase felt like a burden, something that made my debt pile bigger, and that I wouldn't even touch until the rest was gone (plus interest!).\n\nSometimes debt control is a matter of perspective.  After this view, I set myself on my own payment plan, and dug myself out in only a few years.  My debt wasn't as high as some of yours here, but it wasn't small for someone who was only making $15/hr at the time either.\n\nI hope this makes sense, this simple change in view changed my financial path, and hopefully yours too.", "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "2l51u1", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TKCerbs", "media": null, "score": 89, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "mod_reports": [], "saved": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_2l51u1", "permalink": "/r/personalfinance/comments/2l51u1/no_self_control_when_it_comes_to_credit_debt_take/", "stickied": false, "created": 1415028108.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2l51u1/no_self_control_when_it_comes_to_credit_debt_take/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "No self control when it comes to credit debt?

Should I go with an apartment complex or should I hold out and find a house for rent? Should I sacrifice living close to school in exchange for a nicer/cheaper rental?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I currently live in a 2 bedroom town home style apartment with a room mate. We split $650 in rent. He is moving in with his girlfriend in January which means I'll need to make some decisions on where to move. I don't really wish to stay in this apartment. It's expensive for the quality and I know I could live somewhere nicer (my kitchen and bathroom are tiny, like one bedroom apartment tiny) for the same price.\n\nI have a few options I've been thinking of which I'll list here. My current apartment is about 10 miles from school.\n\n* Stay in my apartment and go on a month to month lease which would probably cost me $700 monthly plus utilities while I look for a place.\n* Rent an apartment in a complex close to school. 2 bedroom ranges $650-900. Try to swing that on my own and find a room mate. Hope that the complex isn't god awful.\n* Rent a house for $650-$750 and find a room mate or try to swing it on my own.\n* Rent an apartment somewhere that isn't next to school. 1 bedroom would probably cost $450-600\n\nI've been looking around for a room mate but I haven't been able to find one. I've had bad experiences in the past and I have a hard time trusting people. I'd really like to get a house. I feel like it's cheaper to rent a 2-3 bedroom house. I could then try to find a room mate after I rent out a house. The only problem here is that I might need to stay in my apartment and pay the extra money for a month to month lease until I find a good house to rent out.\n\nMy mom has agreed to help me out a bit with rent (about $200) which is helpful. I'm living off student loans and my internship. I get about 4-5k every four months and I make about $400 a month at my internship. \n\nI felt like moving into an apartment right next to campus would save me money (gas/parking permit) but it seems that all these properties are really expensive for mediocre quality. I know they are charging for the convenience. Parking is awful for guests, too. They tow like crazy. Couldn't I just get a nicer house for the same/cheaper price? \n\nTL;DR I'm a single college student living off loans. I'm 24 so I'd prefer to live somewhere nice where I'd be comfortable living for a couple of years. I'm open to room mates.

Then we (girlfriend and I) decided to move to a bigger city in hopes of better future career opportunity.  Unfortunately, I was unexpectedly laid off my job only 2 months after moving.  Despite our optimism, I could not find a job in my field for anything (many last interviews, but no offers), and I was unable to find temp work or min wage work (min wage jobs outright told me I was overqualified and didn&amp;#39;t want turnaround).  I blew through my unemployment and ALL my savings getting by in this higher cost area of living before moving back cross country to live with my girlfriend&amp;#39;s parents in August.  If it weren&amp;#39;t for them offering to take us in, we would very well be homeless.  We currently only have $1000 to our names and 3 pets to take care of on top of it.  I also had to sell my car (old car, and I couldn&amp;#39;t afford it&amp;#39;s repairs so I had to sell it), and lots of our furniture and personal possessions were sold as well.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I feel overwhelmingly hopeless that we will never be able to recover and acquire financial security again.  I was hoping we could stay at my girlfriend&amp;#39;s parents for up to a year while we rebuilt our savings, but her parents are getting very disgusted by us staying here, they have a very tiny home we all don&amp;#39;t fit in, and their dog and our dogs are having massive conflicts.  Basically no one is happy here.  It&amp;#39;s a shame her parents are having a change of heart about us living with them now too...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the rundown of where we are currently at:\n- We currently live in a very tiny rural town without much opportunity.  A major city is about an hour commute away though.&lt;br/&gt;\n- We really need to get our own place, but because of our pets we are unable to get into the cheap apartments we can afford in the $500-700 range, and the next cheapest places/homes we have found for rent that would allow our pets are $900-1500...\n- We both did find low paying jobs in the area.  My girlfriend graduated with her B.S. degree and found an entry level job in her field paying $15 an hour.  I found a warehouse job for $10 an hour.  It&amp;#39;s something, but I look at if we moved out and pretty much all our income would be going to expenses/bills.\n- I&amp;#39;ve pretty much given up hope on finding work in my old career.  I had worked as a Sound Designer in video games for 4 years, but the job competition is insane and the job security nonexistent.  I&amp;#39;m currently back in college online earning my B.S. degree in Accounting and Business Management (hoping to find work in either HR or Accounting), but I will not graduate for another 8 months minimum.  I don&amp;#39;t know how hopeful I feel about finding a decent job either after graduating, and it will probably require a relocation... Basically, I&amp;#39;m not too optimistic about gainful employment after getting my degree, but my past experiences may have just made me cynical.&lt;br/&gt;\n- Another thing, any type of distant relocation is out of the question at this point.  :(  This limits the job opportunities we could apply for, especially if I ever happened to find something in my old career of sound for games.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, the only option I see right now given the circumstances is that we get our own place in town to live, which will pretty much require us to use most, if not all, of our income to get by.  My warehouse job is not very stable either, as some weeks I only get 20 hours and others 40.  I don&amp;#39;t see how we will ever be able to build up our savings at this rate and recover from this terrible situation we found ourselves in.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does reddit suggest I do?  I&amp;#39;ve thought of joining the military, but unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t agree with what the military currently stands for (basically fighting a rich man&amp;#39;s greed battle), and ALL of my family are strongly against me joining the military.  I figured I could try to take out extra student loans for living expenses, but I would like to keep my debt to a minimum.  Lastly, it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning that me and my girlfriend are not careless spenders and very good with our finances.  We both have always lived financially secure up until last year, and our credit scores are both excellent (750+).  One last option would be to ask some of my family members for financial help, but I generally feel terrible about doing that.  I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to burden them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for hearing me out.
